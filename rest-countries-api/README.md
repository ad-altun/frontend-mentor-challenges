## About The Project

This project is a frontend challenge designed to test and improve your JavaScript and web development skills. It consumes data from the [REST Countries API (v3.1)](https://restcountries.com/) to display country information in an interactive and visually organized way.

You can build this project using any JavaScript framework or library, such as React, Vue, or Vanilla JS. You also have full flexibility in how you manage styling, data fetching, and application structure.

### Users should be able to:
- View all countries on the homepage using data from the REST Countries API.
- Search for a country by its common name using an input field.
- Filter countries by their region (e.g., Asia, Europe).
- Click on a country card to view detailed information on a dedicated detail page.
- From the detail page, navigate to border countries via interactive links.
- Toggle between light and dark mode for a better user experience (optional).
